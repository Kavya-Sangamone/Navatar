  Mobile App (to control the car)
  Linode Server (with a public IP)
  Raspberry Pi (connected to the car wheels)
  Wheels + Motor Driver
  Ngrok (to connect your Pi to the internet)



You tap "Forward" in the mobile app from home â†’
That command goes to the Raspberry Pi in college â†’
Raspberry Pi makes the car move forward.


Mobile App â†’ Linode Server â†’ Raspberry Pi (via Ngrok) â†’ Motor Driver â†’ Wheels move


   ðŸ”§ What You Already Have

    Raspberry Pi
    Linode Server (public IP like  172.232.193.93 )
    4 wheels + motor driver
    Mobile device
    Internet connection
    Ngrok (we'll install it)

    ðŸŸ© Step 1:   Set up Raspberry Pi  

1. Connect wheels and motor driver to Raspberry Pi using GPIO pins.
2. Install Python and Flask:

    
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 pip
   pip3 install flask
      
3. Create a small   Flask server   on the Pi (to listen for commands like "forward").


ðŸŸ¨ Step 2:   Install Ngrok on Raspberry Pi  

1. Go to [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com), create a free account.
2. Download Ngrok on Pi and install:

   wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok stable linux arm.zip
   unzip ngrok stable linux arm.zip
  
3. Connect Ngrok to your account:
    
   ./ngrok authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
      
4. Start Ngrok:

   ./ngrok http 5000
      
     Now Ngrok gives you a public URL (like  https://abc123.ngrok.io )

   

ðŸŸ§ Step 3:   Create API on Linode Server  

1. Install Python, Django, and Django REST Framework:

    
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 pip
   pip3 install django djangorestframework
      
2. Create a Django project and add a simple API that:

     Receives POST requests from the mobile app
     Forwards the command to the Ngrok URL (Raspberry Pi)

   
 ðŸŸ¥ Step 4:   Mobile App  

1. Build a mobile app using   Flutter   or   Android Studio  .
2. The app sends commands (like "forward", "stop", etc.) to your   Linode server IP   (e.g.,  http://172.232.193.93/command ).
3. Linode then forwards this command to Raspberry Pi using the Ngrok URL.

   

  

1.   Mobile app   sends:

      
   POST http://172.232.193.93/command
   Body: { "command": "forward" }
      

2.   Django on Linode   receives it and sends:

      
   POST https://abc123.ngrok.io/move
   Body: { "command": "forward" }
      

3.   Raspberry Pi   gets it and turns the motors on.
